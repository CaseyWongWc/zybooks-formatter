5.1 Loops (general)
Loop concept
People who have children may be familiar with looping around the block until a baby falls asleep.

participation activity
5.1.1: Loop concept: Driving a baby around the block.

Start
Awake?3rd check2nd check1st checkFalseTrueBaby in car
Step 1: Parents may be familiar with this scenario: Driving home, the baby is awake. Parents circle the block, hoping the baby will fall asleep. A diagram of a house, car, and a block near the house. There is a line/road between the house and the block. The block is in the shape of a triangle. The car starts at one point of the triangle, which is labelled Awake? The text True appears on one line of the triangle. The text False appears on the line/road going from block/triangle to the house. The car drives around the triangle, ending at the same point the car started. A picture of a sad baby appears, with the label 1st check below the baby, and the text Baby in car above the sad baby. Step 2: After the first loop, the baby is still awake, so the parents loop again. The car drives around the triangle/block again, ending at the same point of the triangle that it started. A second picture of a sad baby appears, with the text 2nd check below the sad baby. Step 3: After the second loop, the baby is asleep, so the parents head home for a peaceful evening. The car starts at the same point as before, but this time, drives straight to the house rather than driving around the triangle. The line between the starting point and the house is labelled False. A third picture of a baby appears, but this time the baby is happy and sleepy. The label below the baby is 3rd check.

Loop basics
A loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes the loop's statements (known as the loop body) while the loop's expression is true; when the expression is false, execution proceeds past the loop. Each time through a loop's statements is called an iteration.

5.1.3: A simple loop: Summing the input values.

Static Figure: A diagram with an arrow pointing down. There is a defined diamond near the top of the arrow. A series of lines create a loop starting at the diamond and to the right of the downward pointing arrow. This loop is fairly rectangular, but ends with an arrow pointing back to the diamond. A program is superimposed on the loop and arrow. The following code appears at the top of the downward pointing arrow, above the diamond: sum = 0 val = Get next input The following code is displayed next to the diamond and the right horizontal line of the loop: While val > -1 The following code is displayed inside the loop: sum = sum + val val = Get next input The following code is displayed between the diamond and the bottom or point of the downward pointing arrow: Put sum to output Next to the diagram, the text Input is displayed, with a box below that contains the numbers: 2 4 1 -1 The output console contains 1 line of output: 7 Next to the diagram, the following text is displayed: sum: 0 2 6 7 The 0, 2, and 6 are faded, while the 7 is a stronger color. Step 1: A loop is like a branch, but the loop jumps back to the expression when done. Thus, the loop's statements may execute multiple times before execution proceeds past the loop. A diagram with an arrow pointing down. There is a defined diamond near the top of the arrow. A series of lines create a loop starting at the diamond and to the right of the downward pointing arrow. This loop is fairly rectangular, but ends with an arrow pointing back to the diamond. A small square travels down the downward pointing arrow, to the diamond. Then, the square goes around the loop back to the diamond, and then goes around the loop back to the diamond again. Then, the square travels down the downward pointing arrow until the square reaches the bottom/point of the downward pointing arrow. Step 2: This program receives an input value. If the value > -1, the program adds the value to a sum, receives another input, and repeats. val is 2, so the loop's statements execute, making sum 2. A program appears superimposed on the loop and arrow described in step 1. Next to the diagram, the text Input appears, with a box below that contains the numbers: 2 4 1 -1 The text Output appears, with an empty box below. This is the output console. In the diagram, the following code appears at the top of the downward pointing arrow, above the diamond: sum = 0 val = Get next input The square starts travelling again. The square travels by sum = 0, and the text sum: 0 appears next to the diagram. The square travels by val = Get next input, where the value 2 is shown. The square travels to the diamond, where the text While val > -1 is displayed. This condition is true, so the square travels along the horizontal line of the loop, going right. Within the loop, the square travels by the code sum = sum + val Then, sum: 2 is displayed beside the loop diagram. Then, the square travels by the code val = Get next input within the loop, where 4 is displayed as the value for val. Then, the square completes travelling around the loop, and returns to the diamond. Step 3: The loop's statements ended by receiving the next input, which is 4. The loop's expression 4 > -1 is true, so the loop's statements execute again, making sum 2 + 4 or 6. While val > -1 is true, so the square starts travelling the loop again, moving to the right horizontally. The square travels to the code sum = sum + val The text sum: 6 is displayed next to the loop diagram. Then, the square travels by the code val = Get next input within the loop, where 1 is displayed as the value for val. Then, the square completes travelling around the loop, and returns to the diamond. Step 4: The loop's statements receive the next input of 1. The loop's expression 1 > -1 is true, so the loop's statements execute a third time, making sum 6 + 1 or 7. While val > -1 is true, so the square starts travelling the loop again, moving to the right horizontally. The square travels to the code sum = sum + val The text sum: 7 is displayed next to the loop diagram. Then, the square travels by the code val = Get next input within the loop, where -1 is displayed as the value for val. Then, the square completes travelling around the loop, and returns to the diamond. Step 5: The next input is -1. This time, -1 > -1 is false, so the loop is not entered. Instead, execution proceeds past the loop, where a statement puts sum, which is 7, to the output. The square travels downward from the diamond, down the downward pointing arrow. The square travels by the code Put sum to output The output console now contains 1 line of output: 7

A loop is like a branch, but the loop jumps back to the expression when done. Thus, the loop's statements may execute multiple times before execution proceeds past the loop.
This program receives an input value. If the value > -1, the program adds the value to a sum, receives another input, and repeats. val is 2, so the loop's statements execute, making sum 2.
The loop's statements ended by receiving the next input, which is 4. The loop's expression 4 > -1 is true, so the loop's statements execute again, making sum 2 + 4 or 6.
The loop's statements receive the next input of 1. The loop's expression 1 > -1 is true, so the loop's statements execute a third time, making sum 6 + 1 or 7.
The next input is -1. This time, -1 > -1 is false, so the loop is not entered. Instead, execution proceeds past the loop, where a statement puts sum, which is 7, to the output.

The condition While val > -1 is false, so the square does not enter the loop, and instead travels downward down the downward pointing arrow. The square travels by the code avg = sum / num Then, 15 / 3 is displayed next to this code. Then, the result of this expression 5, is displayed. Then the square travles by the code Put avg to output The output console now contains 1 line of output: 5

The program computes an average of a list of numbers (a negative ends the list). The first input is 2, so the loop is entered. Sum becomes 2, and num is incremented to 1.
The next input is 4. The loop is entered, so sum becomes 2 + 4 or 6, and num is incremented to 2.
The next input is 9, so the loop is entered. Sum becomes 6 + 9 or 15, and num is incremented to 3.
The next input is -1, so the loop is not entered. 15 / 3 or 5 is output.

Example: Counting specific values in a list
Programs execute one statement at a time. Thus, using a loop to examine a list of values one value at a time and updating variables along the way, as in the above examples, is a common programming task.

Below is a task to help a person get accustomed to examining a list of values one value at a time. The task asks a person to count the number of negative values, incrementing a variable to keep count.

Example: Finding the max value
Examining items one at a time and updating a variable can achieve some interesting computations. The task below is to find the maximum value in a list of positive values. A variable stores the max value seen so far. Each input value is compared with that max, and if greater, that value replaces that max. The max value is initialized with -1 so that such comparison works even for the first input value.

5.1.9: Determining the max value.
Complete the program so the variable max ends up having the maximum value in an input list of positive values (the list ends with 0). So if the input is 22 5 99 3 0, then max should end as 99.

max = -1

What should expression (A) be?
2)
What should statement (B) be?
3)
Does the final value of max depend on the order of inputs? In particular, would max be different for inputs 22 5 99 3 0 versus inputs 99 3 5 22 0?
