5.5 For loops
Survey
The following questions are part of a zyBooks survey to help us improve our content so we can offer the best experience for students. The survey can be taken anonymously and takes just 3-5 minutes. Please take a short moment to answer the student survey.

Introduction to for loops
A common programming task is to access all of the elements in a container, one by one, so that the elements can be used. Ex: Printing every item in a list. A for loop statement iterates over each element in a container one at a time, assigning a variable to the next element to use in the loop body. Each iteration updates the variable with the next element. The container is typically a list, string, or dictionary. A for loop is made of a for statement, followed by an indented loop body.

Construct 5.5.1: For loop.
for variable in container:
    # Loop body: Statements to execute
    # for each item in the container

# Statements to execute after the for loop is complete

5.5.1: Iterating over a list using a for loop.

Start
for list_name in ["Kai", "Sam", "Alex"]:
    print(f"Hi {list_name}!")

print("Done")
Static figure: A code block, output console, and the variable name are displayed. Begin Python code: for list_name in ["Kai", "Sam", "Alex"]: print(f"Hi {list_name}!") print("Done") End Python code. Step 1: The first iteration assigns the variable list_name with "Kai" and prints Hi Kai! to the output. The line of code, print(f"Hi {list_name}!"), is highlighted and list_name now contains the text, "Kai". The text, Hi Kai!, is output to the console. Step 2: The second iteration assigns the variable list_name with "Sam" and prints Hi Sam! The third iteration assigns the variable list_name with "Alex" and prints Hi Alex! The line of code, for list_name in ["Kai", "Sam", "Alex"]:, is highlighted and list_name now contains the text, "Sam". The line of code, print(f"Hi {list_name}!"), is highlighted and the text, Hi Sam!, is output to the console. The line of code, for list_name in ["Kai", "Sam", "Alex"]:, is highlighted and list_name now contains the text, "Alex". The line of code, print(f"Hi {list_name}!"), is highlighted and the text, Hi Alex!, is output to the console. Step 3: All of the elements in the list have been iterated through, so the for loop ends. The program prints Done. The line of code, print("Done") is highlighted. Done is output to the console.

For loops with strings and dictionaries
A for loop can iterate over other containers such as strings and dictionaries. A string is a sequence type like a list, so the behavior of the loop is identical. Each iteration assigns the loop variable with the next character in the string. Ex: A for loop iterates over each character in the string "blue" beginning with "b" as the leftmost character, then each following character in the string.

Iterating over a dictionary using a for loop assigns the loop variable with each key in the dictionary in the order the keys were inserted. The key's value can then be accessed using the key.

5.5.3: Iterating over a string using a for loop.

Start
my_str = "Yes"

for char in my_str:
    print(char)
Static figure: A code block, output console, and the variable name are displayed. Begin Python code: my_str = "Yes" for char in my_string: print(char) End Python code. Step 1: The variable my_str is set to "Yes". The line of code, my_str = "Yes" is highlighted. Yes moves to the Python interpreter. Step 2: The loop iterates over "Y", the first character in my_string. Y is then printed to the output. The line of code, for char in my_str is highlighted. Y moves to my_str. The line of code, print(char) is highlighted and Y moves to the output. Step 3: The loop iterates over then prints each remaining character in my_str. The line of code, for char in my_str is highlighted. e moves to my_str. The line of code, print(char) is highlighted and e moves to the output. The line of code, for char in my_str is highlighted. s moves to my_str. The line of code, print(char) is highlighted and s moves to the output.

5.5.4: Iterating over a dictionary using a for loop.

Start
channels = {
    "MTV": 35,
    "CNN": 28,
    "NBC": 4
}

for channel_name in channels:
    print(f"{channel_name} is on channel {channels[channel_name]}")
Static figure: A code block, output console, and the variable name are displayed. Begin Python code: channels = { "MTV": 35, "CNN": 28, "NBC": 4 } for c in channels: print(f"{c} is on channel {channels[c]}") End Python code. Step 1: A dictionary named channels is created. The keys are the names of channels, and the values are the channel numbers. The lines of code, channels = {"MTV": 35, "CNN": 28, "NBC": 4} are highlighted. A box appears next to "MTV", "CNN", and "NBC" with the word keys next to it. A box appears next to 35, 28, and 4 with the word values next to it. Step 2: The key and respective value is printed. The line of code, for c in channels is highlighted. "MTV" moves to c. The line of code, print(f"{c} is on channel {channels[c]}") is highlighted. 35 moves to [c]. MTV is on channel 35 moves to the output. Step 3: The process repeats for each key in the dictionary. The line of code, for c in channels is highlighted. "CNN" moves to c. The line of code, print(f"{c} is on channel {channels[c]}") is highlighted. 28 moves to [c]. CNN is on channel 28 moves to the output. The line of code, for c in channels is highlighted. "NBC" moves to c. The line of code, print(f"{c} is on channel {channels[c]}") is highlighted. 4 moves to [c]. NBC is on channel 4 moves to the output.

For loop examples
For loops can be used to perform action during each loop iteration. A simple example is printing the value, as above examples demonstrated. The program below uses an additional variable to sum list elements to calculate weekly and average daily revenue.

A for loop may also iterate backward over a sequence, starting at the last element and ending with the first element, by using the reversed() function to reverse the order of the elements.

Figure 5.5.1: For loop example: Calculating shop revenue.
daily_revenues = [
    2350.25,  # Monday
    1800.50,  # Tuesday
    1795.00,  # Wednesday
    2050.25,  # Thursday
    1985.75,  # Friday
    2005.00,  # Saturday
    1890.50   # Sunday
]

total = 0
for day in daily_revenues:
    total += day

average = total / len(daily_revenues)

print(f"Weekly revenue: ${total:.2f}")
print(f"Daily average revenue: ${average:.2f}")
Weekly revenue: $13877.25
Daily average revenue: $1982.46
