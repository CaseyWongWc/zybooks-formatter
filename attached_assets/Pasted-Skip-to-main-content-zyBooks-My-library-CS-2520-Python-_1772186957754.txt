5.8 Nested loops
Nested loops
A nested loop is a loop that appears as part of the body of another loop. The nested loops are commonly referred to as the outer loop and inner loop.

Nested loops have various uses. One use is to generate all combinations of some items. Ex: The following program generates all two-letter .com Internet domain names. Recall that ord() converts a one-character string into an integer, and chr() converts an integer into a character. Thus, chr(ord("a") + 1) results in "b".

Figure 5.8.1: Nested loops example: Two-letter domain name printing program.
"""
Program to print all two-letter domain names.

Note that ord() and chr() convert between text and the ASCII or Unicode encoding:
-  ord("a") yields the encoded value of "a", the number 97.
-  ord("a") + 1 adds 1 to the encoded value of "a", giving 98.
-  chr(ord("a") + 1) converts 98 back into a letter, producing "b"
"""
print("Two-letter domain names:")

letter1 = "a"
letter2 = "?"
while letter1 <= "z":  # Outer loop
    letter2 = "a"
    while letter2 <= "z":  # Inner loop
        print(f"{letter1}{letter2}.com")
        letter2 = chr(ord(letter2) + 1)
    letter1 = chr(ord(letter1) + 1)
Two-letter domain names:
aa.com
ab.com
ac.com
ad.com
ae.com
af.com
ag.com
ah.com
ai.com
aj.com
ak.com

(Forget about buying a two-letter domain name: They are all taken, and each sells for several hundred thousand or millions of dollars. Source: dnjournal.com, 2012.)

Try 5.8.1: Two-character .com domain names.

Full screen
Modify the program to include two-character .com names where the second character can be a letter or a number, e.g., a2.com. Hint: Add a second while loop nested in the outer loop, but following the first inner loop, that iterates through the numbers 0-9.

Try 5.8.2: Nested loop example: Histogram.

Full screen
Here is a nested loop example that graphically depicts an integer's magnitude by using asterisks, creating what is commonly called a histogram.

Run the program below and observe the output. Modify the program to print one asterisk per 5 units. So if the user enters 40, print 8 asterisks.

5.8.2: Nested loops: Print rectangle.

Full screen
712910.5105864.qx3zqy7
Given num_rows and num_cols representing the number of rows and columns, organize the lines of code to create nested loops that print a rectangle as shown in the example.

Ex: If the input is:

2
3

then the output is:

* * *
* * *

5.8.3: Nested loops: Print seats.

Full screen
712910.5105864.qx3zqy7
Integers num_rows and num_cols are read from input representing the number of rows and columns of a theater's seating plan. Organize the lines of code to create a nested for loop that outputs each seat label.

In the outer for loop:

Assign the current column's letter with "A".
In the inner for loop:
Output the current row number and column letter.
Increment the current column letter.
End with a newline.
Ex: If the input is:

2
3

then the output is:

1A 1B 1C
2A 2B 2C

Start
Integers start_in and end_in are read from input. The outer while loop executes start_in times. Complete the inner while loop to execute end_in times for each iteration of the outer while loop.

Ex: If the input is:

6
4
then the output is:
